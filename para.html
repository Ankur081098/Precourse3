        The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
        a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript.

        After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995
        completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future
        implementations should be based.[12]
